              "'Most areas of the US saw their economy continue to expand in December and early January, the US Federal Reserve said in its latest Beige Book report.\\n\\nOf the 12 US regions it identifies for the study, 11 showed stronger economic growth, with only the Cleveland area falling behind with a \"mixed\" rating. Consumer spending was higher in December than November, and festive sales were also up on 2003. The employment picture also improved, the Fed said.\\n\\n\"Labour markets firmed in a number of districts, but wage pressures generally remained modest,\" the Beige Book said. \"Several districts reported higher prices for building materials and manufacturing inputs, but most reported steady or only slightly higher overall price levels.\" The report added that residential real estate activity remained strong and that commercial real estate activity strengthened in most districts. \"Office leasing was especially brisk in Washington DC, and New York City, two of the nation\\'s strongest commercial markets,\" the Fed said.\\n\\nThe US economy has grown more than expected, expanding at an annual rate of 3.8% in the last quarter of 2004.\\n\\nThe gross domestic product figure was ahead of the 3.1% the government estimated a month ago. The rise reflects stronger spending by businesses on capital equipment and a smaller-than-expected trade deficit. GDP is a measure of a country\\'s economic health, reflecting the value of the goods and services it produces.\\n\\nThe new GDP figure, announced by the Commerce Department on Friday, also topped the 3.5% growth rate that economists had forecast ahead of Friday\\'s announcement. Growth was at an annual rate of 4% in the third quarter of 2004 and for the year it came in at 4.4%, the best figure in five years. However, the positive economic climate may lead to a rise in interest rates, with many expecting US rates to rise on 22 March. In the January-to-March quarter, the economy is expected to grow at an annual rate of about 4%, economists forecast. In the final quarter of 2004, businesses increased spending on capital equipment and software by 18%, up from 17.5% in the third quarter. Consumer spending grew 4.2% in the final quarter, down from the third quarter\\'s 5.1%.\\n\\nThe US dollar has continued its record-breaking slide and has tumbled to a new low against the euro.\\n\\nInvestors are betting that the European Central Bank (ECB) will not do anything to weaken the euro, while the US is thought to favour a declining dollar. The US is struggling with a ballooning trade deficit and analysts said one of the easiest ways to fund it was by allowing a depreciation of the dollar. They have predicted that the dollar is likely to fall even further.\\n\\nThe US currency was trading at $1.364 per euro at 1800 GMT on Monday. This compares with $1.354 to the euro in late trading in New York on Friday, which was then a record low.\\n\\nThe dollar has weakened sharply since September when it traded about $1.20 against the euro. It has lost 7% this year, while against the Japanese yen it is down 3.2%. Traders said that thin trading levels had amplified Monday\\'s move. \"It\\'s not going to take much to push [the dollar] one way or the other,\" said Grant Wilson of Mellon Bank. Liquidity - a measure of the number of parties willing to trade in the market - was about half that of a normal working day, traders said.\\n\\nMexican labourers living in the US sent a record $16.6bn (£8.82bn) home last year.\\n\\nThe Bank of Mexico said that remittances grew 24% last year and now represent the country\\'s second-biggest source of income after oil. Better records and greater prosperity of Mexican expatriates in the US are the main reasons behind the increase. About 10 million Mexicans live in the US, where there are 16 million citizens of Mexican origin. Remittances now represent more than 2% of the country\\'s GDP, according to the Bank of Mexico\\'s figures. Last year, there were 50.9 million transactions, with an average value of $327 per remittance, the bank said. According to Standard & Poor\\'s, which has recently upgraded Mexico\\'s sovereign debt rating, the rise in remittances helps protect the Mexican economy against a potential fall in the international oil prices.\\n\\nThe growth in remittances has sparked fierce competition between banks. Bank of America announced last week that it planned to eliminate transfer fees for some customers. Remittance charges are estimated to have dropped by between 50 and 60%, reports from the US Treasury and the Inter-American Development Bank have said. The Inter-American Development Bank estimates that remittances to Latin America and the Caribbean reached $45bn in 2004.\\n\\nUS industrial production increased for the 21st month in a row in February, but at a slower pace than in January, official figures show.\\n\\nThe Institute for Supply Management (ISM) index fell to 55.3 in February, from an adjusted 56.4 in January. Although the index was lower than in January, the fact that it held above 50 shows continued growth in the sector. \"February was another good month in the manufacturing sector,\" said ISM survey chairman Norbert Ore.\\n\\n\"While the overall rate of growth is slowing, the overall picture is improving as price increases and shortages are becoming less of a problem. Exports and imports remain strong,\" he said. Analysts had expected February\\'s figure to be stronger than January\\'s and come in at 57. Of the 20 manufacturing sectors surveyed by ISM, 13 reported growth. They included the textiles, apparel, tobacco, chemicals and transportation sectors. The ISM\\'s index of national manufacturing activity is compiled from the responses of purchasing executives at more than 400 industrial companies.\\n\\n'"

They will also talk to Fisheries Minister Ross Finnie and scientists. MPs are deciding whether to recommend a new system of \"community quotas\" to conserve fish stocks. The aim is that fishing ports like Peterhead or Fraserburgh would be allocated a quota and local people would decide how to fish it. The scheme is a variation on the local management committees already being established by the European Union.\\n\\nDetails are contained in a Royal Commission report for the UK Government, along with the more controversial idea of closing some mixed fishing grounds completely. Six members of the committee will be in Scotland to seek views from fishermen and processors in Aberdeen and Peterhead. They will also speak to Mr Finnie, representatives of the Royal Society and the Sea Fish Industry Authority.
